# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

If you own a bike (e.g. a mountain bike), it needs to be maintained regularly to keep it running smoothly. Remembering what tasks need to be completed and when can be tricky, meaning that tasks get forgotten.

There is a need for a simple system that allows tasks to be be noted down and then for the user to be reminded of them.


## End-User Requirements

The typical end-user would be a bike owner who wants to do their own bike maintenance. They will be knowledgeable about bikes. However, they won't necessarily be technically skilled. This means that the system will need to cater for people with a range of IT skills - the system must be intuitive to use.


## Proposed Solution

A system that allows someone to track maintenance jobs for their bikes.

- Bikes can be added to the system
- Maintenance tasks can be defined for the bikes and added to the system
- Tasks can be one-offs or can be repeating ones
- Tasks that have not yet been completed are clearly listed
- Tasks can be marked as completed
- When a repeating task is marked as complete, it will be marked as incomplete again after a set amount of time

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality

A functional system is one that works as intended. All of the expected features work, data displayed is accurate and no unexpected behaviour is shown.

### Relevance to the System

It is important that this system is fully functional otherwise the users will end up missing key bike maintenance tasks. If this happens, the user will lose faith with the system and will stop using it.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to ensure that each part of the system works as expected. This can be down by thoroughly testing the system with a range of different input data, and a range of scenarios. For example, I can add a range of tasks with different data: some one-off tasks, some repeating tasks; then check that they are shown correctly, check they can be marked as done, check that repeating tasks re-occur, etc.


## Usability

A system is usable if it is intuitive to use.

### Relevance to the System

It is important that this system is usable so that blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

### Impact / Considerations

As I design this system I will keep in mind [Neilssen's Usability Heuristics](https://...). I will ensure that blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

When I am testing the system and/or getting end-user feedback, I will blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
